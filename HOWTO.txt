Working with the plugin is exactly like working with the original Selenium IDE (can be found here: http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/02_selenium_ide.jsp).

Whenever you want to create a TestREx test:
1- open Firefox and surf to the website you want to test
2- in Firefox go to: Menu Bar -> Tools -> Selenium IDE
3- Selenium will start as an external application, with the record button (red button in Selenium IDE) pressed, Which means that Selenium is recording your "moves"
4- make sure that the Base URL is set to the website you are testing
5- start "moving" in the website while making sure Selenium is recording these moves
6- you can also insert "moves"/commands on your own by manually writing them in an empty line in Seleium IDE, it's especially good for inserting assertions

After finishing to record your test you can export a Selenium python script, by navigating to "File -> Export Test Case As ... -> python-TestREx" inside Selenium IDE.

To run the exported script, you should have the TestREx project:
1- Put the newly exported python script inside [TestREx project directory]/data/exploits directory.
2- run it by a command line like this:

sudo python [TestREx project directory]/run.py --single [docker image/ target application source] --exploit [exported Selenium script].py --verbose --visible

for example:

[TestREx project directory]/run.py --single xssreflected__ubuntu-node --exploit python_test.py --verbose --visible
